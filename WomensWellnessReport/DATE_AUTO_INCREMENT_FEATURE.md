# Date Selection & Auto-Increment Feature

## ✅ Feature Added

I've added a date selector and auto-increment option to the Daily Entry form to make it easy to create multiple entries for different dates.

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. **Date Selector**
- A date picker at the top of the Daily Entry form
- Defaults to today's date
- Allows you to select any past date (cannot select future dates)
- The selected date is saved with your entry

### 2. **Auto-Increment Option**
- A checkbox: "🔄 Auto-advance to next day after saving"
- When enabled:
  - After saving an entry, the date automatically moves to the next day
  - This makes it super easy to build multiple entries quickly
  - You can just fill the form → save → fill again → save (date advances automatically)

## 📖 How to Use

### Option 1: Manual Date Selection
1. Select the date you want for the entry using the date picker
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Save Today's Entry"
4. The entry is saved for the selected date

### Option 2: Auto-Increment (Recommended for Multiple Entries)
1. **Enable the checkbox**: "Auto-advance to next day after saving"
2. Select your starting date (e.g., November 1st)
3. Fill out the form and save
4. **The date automatically moves to November 2nd**
5. Fill out the form again and save
6. **The date automatically moves to November 3rd**
7. Repeat as needed!

## 💡 Benefits

- **Quick Data Entry**: Build your wellness history rapidly
- **No Manual Date Changes**: When auto-increment is on, you don't need to change dates manually
- **Prevents Mistakes**: Less chance of accidentally saving multiple entries for the same date
- **Flexible**: You can still manually select dates when needed
- **Visual Feedback**: The success message shows when the date was auto-advanced

## 🎨 User Interface

The date selector appears as a card at the top of the form with:
- Date picker input
- Checkbox for auto-increment
- Helpful text explaining the feature

## ✅ Example Workflow

**To quickly create 3 entries:**

1. Open Daily Entry page
2. ✅ Enable "Auto-advance to next day after saving"
3. Date shows: November 1st
4. Fill form → Save
5. Date automatically changes to: November 2nd ✅
6. Fill form → Save
7. Date automatically changes to: November 3rd ✅
8. Fill form → Save
9. Done! You now have 3 entries for 3 different dates! 🎉

## 📝 Notes

- **Same Date Behavior**: If you save for a date that already has an entry, it will still UPDATE that entry (by design)
- **Date Validation**: You cannot select future dates
- **Flexibility**: You can turn auto-increment on/off anytime
- **Manual Override**: Even with auto-increment enabled, you can manually change the date if needed

## 🎯 Result

This feature makes it **much easier** to build your wellness history with multiple entries, which will unlock:
- ✅ Trends & Analytics (needs 3+ entries)
- ✅ Weekly Reports (needs 3+ entries)
- ✅ Monthly Reports (needs 7+ entries)
- ✅ Cycle Forecasts (needs 2+ cycles)

Enjoy building your wellness history! 📊✨
